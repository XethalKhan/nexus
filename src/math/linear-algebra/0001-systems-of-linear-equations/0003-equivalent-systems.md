# Equivalent systems

Two **systems of linear equations** are **equivalent** if their **solution sets** are equal.

Notice here that the two systems of equations could look very different (i.e. not be equal), but still have equal solution sets, and we would then call the system equivalent. Two linear equations in two variables might be plotted as two lines that intersect in a single point. A different system, with three equations in two variables might have a plot that is three lines, all intersecting at common point, with this common point identical to the intersection point for the first system. By our definition, we could then say these two very different looking systems of equations are equivalent, since they have identical solution sets. It is really like a weaker form of equality, where we allow systems to be different in some respects, but we use the term **equivalent** to highlight the situation when their solution sets are equal.
