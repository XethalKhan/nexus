# Equation operations

Given a **system of linear equations**, the following three operations will transform the system into a different one, and each operation is know as an **equation operation**:

1. swap the locations of two equations (swapping)
2. multiply each term of an equation by nonzero quantity (multiply by a scalar or rescaling)
3. multiply each term of one equation by one quantity and add these terms to a second equation, on both sides of the equality. Leave the first equation the same after this operation, but replace the second equation by the new one (pivoting)

These three operations are also refered to as the:

1. elementary reduction operation
2. row operations
3. Gaussian operations
