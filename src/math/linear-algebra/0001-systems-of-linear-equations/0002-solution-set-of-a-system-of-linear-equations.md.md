# Solution set of a system of linear equations

The solution set of a system of linear equations is the **set** which contains every solution to the system, and nothing more.

Be aware that solution set can be infinite, or there can be no solutions, in which case we write the solution set as the **empty set**
$\emptyset = \\{\\}$
