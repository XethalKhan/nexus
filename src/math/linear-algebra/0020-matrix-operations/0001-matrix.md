# Matrix

## Definition

An $m \times n$ **matrix** is a rectangular layout of numbers from $\mathbb{R}$ having $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

We will use upper-case Latin letters from the start of the alphabet ($A, B, C, \cdots$) to denote matrices and squared-off brackets to delimit the layout. For a matrix $A$, the notation $A_{ij}$ will refer to the real number in row $i$ and column $j$ of $A$. Each number in the matrix is an **entry**.

$$
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
    -1 & 2 & 5 & 3\\
    1 & 0 & -6 & 1\\
    4 & 2 & 2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

is a matrix with $m = 3$ rows and $n = 4$ columns. We say that $B_{2,3} = -6$ while $B_{3,4} = -2$.
