    "The roster method has the obvious advantage of avoiding the problem of deciding well definedness. Whenever it's used (provided the objects named as elements have meaning), there can be no more doubt as to which objects are, and are not, in the set. On the other hand, if the set to be described is large, the roster method can be impractical or impossible to employ.\n",
