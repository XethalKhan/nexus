    "A **universal set** is the set of all objects under discussion in a particular setting. Idea of a universal set in an absolute sense, that is,  a set containing all objects, leads to serious logical difficulties and so is not used in set theory, but the concept, when applied in a more limited sense, has considerable value. A **universal set** $U$ will often be specified at the start of a problem involving sets, whereas in other situations a universal set is more or less clearly, but implicitly, understood as background to a problem. The role then of a **universal set** is to put some bounds on the nature of the objects that can be considered for membership in the sets involved in a given situation.\n",
