    "# Collection (family) of sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of sets $\\mathcal{A} = \\{ A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots \\} = \\{ A_i | i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ containing a set $A$, corresponding to each positive integer $i$ (where some **universal set** $U$ contains each set $A$, in the collection) is called a **family** (or **collection**) of sets indexed by the set $\\mathbb{N}$ of all positive integers. A positive integer $i$ used to label a set $A$ in the collection is called an **index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection $\\mathcal{A}$ is also sometimes denoted $\\{ \\mathcal{A}_i \\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ or $\\{ \\mathcal{A}_i | i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A_i = \\{ i \\}$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. Then $\\mathcal{A} = \\{A_i | i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} = \\{ \\{ 1 \\}, \\{ 2 \\}, \\{ 3 \\}, \\dots \\}$ is a collection of **singleton** sets. Note that if positive integers $i$ and $j$ are two distinct indices, then $A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset$. For this reason we say that this family of sets is **pairwise disjoint** (or **mutually disjoint**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B_i = \\{ 1, 2, 3, \\dots, i \\}$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ so that $\\mathcal{B} = \\{ \\{ 1 \\}, \\{ 1, 2 \\}, \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}, \\dots \\}$. In this example, for any two indices $i$ and $j$, $i \\lt j$ implies $B_i \\subseteq B_j$. For this reason $\\mathcal{B}$ is called an **increasing** family of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $C_i = [i, \\infty)$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ so that $\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_i | i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ is a family of closed, unbounded intervals satisfying the condition $i \\lt j$ implies $C_j \\subseteq C_i$. Any family of sets indexed by $\\mathbb{N}$ possessing this property is called a **decresing** family of sets. In particular, a collection of intervals satisfying this property is called a **family of nested intervals**.\n",
