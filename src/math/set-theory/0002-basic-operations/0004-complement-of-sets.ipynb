    "Let $A$ be a **subset** of a **universal set** $U$. We define **the complement of $A$**, denoted $A'$, by the rule $A' = \\{ x \\in U | x \\notin A \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complement operation is **unary** - we obtain a resultant set from a single given set. Clearly the complement of $A$ is very much dependent on the **universal set**, as well as on $A$ itself. If $A = \\{ 1 \\}$ then $A'$ is one thing if $U = \\mathbb{N}$, something quite different if $U = \\mathbb{R}$, and something altogether different again if $U = \\{ 1, 2 \\}$ (a **singleton** set in fact, as opposed to an infinite set in the other two cases).\n",
