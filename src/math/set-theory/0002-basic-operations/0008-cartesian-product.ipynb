    "Given sets $A$ and $B$, we define **cartesian product $A \\times B$** (read **A cross B**, cartesian product is often called **cross product**) by the rule $A \\times B = \\{(a, b) | a \\in A \\land b \\in B \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $U$ were the **universal set** for sets $A$ and $B$, it would again be the universal set for $A \\cap B, A \\cup B, A', A - B \\text{ and } A \\triangle B$. Putting it differently, the elements of these sets are the same types of objects as those that constitute $A$ and $B$ themselves. This is not the case for $A \\times B$, **the cartesian product of $A$ and $B$**. The elements of $A \\times B$ are ordered pairs of elements from $A$ and $B$, and thus are not ordinarily members of the **universal set** for $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object $x$ is an element of $A \\times B$ if and only if there exist $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$ such that $x = (a, b)$. Note that there is nothing in the definition to prevent $A$ and $B$ from being the same set.\n",
